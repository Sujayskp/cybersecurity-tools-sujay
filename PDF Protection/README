This is a simple Python script that adds password protection to PDF files using the PyPDF2 library. It was created as part of an internship project at **Inlighn Tech**.

## ✅ Features

- Accepts input and output filenames and password via command line  
- Handles errors such as missing or unreadable files  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- PyPDF2 library  

To install PyPDF2, run:
```bash
pip install PyPDF2
🚀 How to Use
Open Command Prompt in the folder where your script and PDF files are located, and run:

bash
python pdf_protector.py "input.pdf" "output.pdf" "yourpassword"
Example:
python pdf_protector.py "task 5.pdf" "protected_task5.pdf" "1234"
This will generate a new password-protected PDF file named protected_task5.pdf.
