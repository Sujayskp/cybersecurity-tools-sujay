# 🔒 SSH Botnet Using Python

This project simulates an SSH-based botnet controller using Python. It is developed as part of my cybersecurity internship with **Inlighn Tech**. The purpose is to understand how attackers control multiple machines using SSH, execute remote commands, and perform simulated DDoS attacks for educational and ethical hacking purposes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Connect to SSH-enabled devices (bots)
- Execute commands remotely on all bots
- Interactive bash shell session
- Add new bots dynamically
- Save and load botnet using JSON
- Simulated SYN flood DDoS attack using Scapy

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Paramiko](https://pypi.org/project/paramiko/)
- [Scapy](https://pypi.org/project/scapy/)
- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

### ✅ Install packages:

```bash
pip install paramiko scapy colorama
🧪 Usage
Make sure the SSH server is enabled on your system.

Update botnet.json with SSH credentials:

  {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "port": 22
  }
]
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python ssh_botnet.py
Use the menu to:

Add bots

List connected bots

Run commands

Open interactive shell

Save and load botnet

Simulate a DDoS attack (test-only)
