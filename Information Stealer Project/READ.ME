# Information Stealer Using Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is an **educational project** developed as part of my Inlighn Tech Internship.  
It demonstrates how sensitive data can be extracted from a Windows system, such as:
- Saved browser passwords
- Clipboard content
- System & network information

âš  **For educational purposes only** â€“ Do not use this tool on any system without explicit permission.  
The goal is to understand vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- **Chrome Password Extraction** â€“ Retrieves and decrypts saved Google Chrome credentials.
- **Clipboard Capture** â€“ Reads and displays the latest copied text.
- **System Information Gathering** â€“ Collects OS details, IP addresses, MAC address, and hostname.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- `os`, `shutil`, `json`, `base64` â€“ File handling and parsing
- `win32crypt` â€“ Windows DPAPI decryption
- `sqlite3` â€“ Accessing Chromeâ€™s Login Data database
- `pycryptodome` â€“ AES-GCM decryption
- `pyperclip` â€“ Clipboard access
- `platform`, `socket`, `uuid`, `re` â€“ System & network details
- `requests` â€“ Public IP fetching

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pywin32 pycryptodome pyperclip requests
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python info_stealer.py
ðŸ’¡ Run this only on a Windows system with Chrome installed and saved passwords for testing.

ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes
By doing this project, I learned:

How browsers store and encrypt saved credentials.

How to use Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM decryption in Python.

How to access and read SQLite databases.

How to capture clipboard data programmatically.

How to gather system and network information for security testing.

The importance of ethical hacking practices and legal boundaries.
